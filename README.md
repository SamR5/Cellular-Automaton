# Cellular automaton (1D and 2D)

Cellular automata explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).  
  
The Elementary_cellular_automaton.py is the one-dimentional version.  
  
The Automaton2D.py is the two-dimentional version (it requires generate_save.py to be launched first)

## TODO
 - delete the duplicates in the suggested rules
 - add the possibility to have random seed
